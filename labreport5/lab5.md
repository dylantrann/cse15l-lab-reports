# Lab Report 5
For this lab report, I'll be going over the process of turning Lab Report 4 into a script!
Lab Report 4 consisted of a 9 step process, which is pretty lengthy and contains a lot of exact commands and clicks. 
Now that we're comfortable with scripts, it can be easily condensed and made reusable.

We're going to do everything on VSCode, since that's how it would be done manually during the timed trial.

## Creating the Script
To start off, we have to create a new script file.

Press this button located above your current working directory to create a new file.

You will see a new text box appear above your current directories files, which is prompting you to name the file.
When naming the file, the name does not matter as long as you add the extension `.sh` after the name.
In my case, I'm naming the file `debug.sh`, as it debugs the file. 
You will know you correctly made a script file when it has the gree icon show on the right of the file name.

## Coding the Script
Now that the script file has been created, you can start coding it. 

For a reminder, here are the steps required in the process
1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

I mentioned previously that it was a 9 step process, but there are a couple of processes that we aren't going to include in the script.
The first two steps are set-up, which including deleting and forking the repository on GitHub, which is something 

**Step 1:** Deleteing forks.
